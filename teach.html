        Coach Wells
      </h2><hr>
      Coach William Wells is the Teacher of 8th Period World History in room 203 a Joshua High School.<br>
      At the beginning of each class the students are met with a powerpoint going over the information that they will need for the assignment for that day. Assignments are typically a Google Doc to fill out about the powerpoint that they have just seen. These assignments are typically short and easy and can be finished in a couple of minuets. The students then hae the choice to then finish work for their other classes or do something silent for the remainder of class. Coach Wells coaches football for the school and is very pround of amazing moment s that happen during games and will often play clips of those moments at the end of class to students that are interested. While the students are working on the assignment for the day Coach Wells is prone to pull many jokes on his students including, but not limited to, jump scaring, taking phones and putting them in the trash, changing the languages on students phones, ect. Coach Wells can be a laid back teacher at times but will be strict if needed. He is also known to give his students nicknames as well. He has a modern art wall posted in his classroom that students that have everything turned in can add objects to.
