    8th Period World History
  </h2>
  <hr>
  This class period normally starts off with a powerpoint about the topic that the students will be working on that day. After the powerpoint an assignment on a google doc is then typically assigned. The google doc is fairly simple and can be completed in a short amount of time. When a student finishes his/her assignment they are allowed to do work from other classes or whatever they want as long as it's not disruptive to the rest of the class. At the end of class the students are sometimes released 1-2 minuets early as this is the teachers last period before he heads to the field house to work witht eh football players. Class is normally quiet throughout the whole period and problems don't normally form. Student's who turn in all of their work are allowed ot place an item of their choosing onto the modern art wall locate next to the porjector screen. Virtual students who earn this privialge are able to send an image to the teacher to be posted on the wall. Most of time the techer will play music durring the class and is know to show clips of football games to students who are interested or are on the football team to discuss what went right and what went wrong.
